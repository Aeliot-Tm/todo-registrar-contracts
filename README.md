TODO Registrar Contracts
========================

A set of abstractions extracted out of the **[TODO Registrar](https://github.com/Aeliot-Tm/todo-registrar)**.

Can be used to create PHP versions of configurations,
to implement custom handlers for inline configurations,
or to implement a custom registrar without having to use the TODO registrar
as a Composer package, but using its PHAR or Docker versions.
